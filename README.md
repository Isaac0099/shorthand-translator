I am very data constrained with this problem. The 50 or so examples of each word my grandmother provided simply aren't enough to get any reasonable performance. (At least with my current ml skills)

I'd like to come back to this at some point but for now this is a dead project.

Please feel free to msg me if you come across this and have any ideas for how to move forward.
